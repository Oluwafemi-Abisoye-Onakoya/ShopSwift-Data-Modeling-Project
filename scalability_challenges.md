# Potential Challenges in Scaling the Model

The star schema seems like an excellent choice for shopSwift retail analytics however, scaling can introduce challenges:


# Growth of Fact Table

As ShopSwift grows, the FactSales table will accumulate a massive amount of data. This can lead to: 	

- Slow Query Performance: Even with a star schema, extremely large fact tables can become slow without proper indexing, partitioning, and potentially distributed database solutions.
  
- Storage Costs: Storing petabytes of sales data can be expensive.


 # Dimension Table Volatility (SCD Type 2): 
 
 If dimension attributes change frequently (e.g., a product's name or a customer's address), handling these changes (Slowly Changing Dimensions - SCD Type 2) can add complexity to the ETL process and increase the size of dimension tables.
 

# Data Latency: 

As the business scales, the volume of incoming transactional data will increase. Ensuring that this data is processed and loaded into the analytical data model with acceptable latency (e.g., near real-time analytics) can be challenging.


# Complex Business Rules and Transformations: 

As the business evolves, new metrics and complex business rules might require more sophisticated transformations during the ETL process, potentially impacting load times and increasing maintenance overhead.


# Data Governance and Quality: 

With more data and more sources, maintaining data quality, consistency, and governance becomes increasingly difficult. Errors in source systems can propagate into the analytics system, leading to inaccurate reports.


# Resource Contention:

As the number of users and analytical queries increases, there can be contention for database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance bottlenecks.


# Technology Stack Limitations: 

While relational databases can handle significant scale, extremely large datasets might eventually push towards more specialized data warehousing solutions (e.g., cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) or even data lakes for raw data storage.


# Maintaining Historical Inventory Snapshots: 

If inventory changes very frequently, creating daily snapshots for FactInventorySnapshot can lead to a very large table. Depending on the reporting needs, summarizing inventory at a higher granularity (e.g., weekly) might be necessary.
